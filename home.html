Visited this place with much enthusiasm as I had heard much about this place.
 Got lost by the google maps and had a hard time locating the place. Anyways, an amazing place to chill with friends. A small place but good ambi
 ence and nicely decorated. Ordered a Hot Chocolate Fudge and an
 Unusual Oreo. They were amazing. It was a perfec
 t day that ended
 well with that visit. L
 ooking forward for my next visi
